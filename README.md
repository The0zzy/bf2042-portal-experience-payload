# PAYLOAD #
This classic game mode is known from Team Fortress, Overwatch, CoD and many other titles. 
One team needs to deliver the Payload to the target while the other team must stop it or even push it back. 
Get close to the Payload to push it. The more players that push the Payload, the faster it will move. 
Along the way there are checkpoints which will add additional time. Defenders can contest the payload and push it back to the last checkpoint. 
Attackers win by pushing the Payload to it's final target before the time runs out.

Fight across multiple maps and all the eras of Battlefield, from the WW2 deserts of El Alamein to the near future factories of Spearhead

## Varieties ##
- **Classic:** Attackers vs Defenders with checkpoints along the way of the payload
- **TOW (Tug of War):** The payload starts in the middle of the track and the team pushing it to the opposing end wins
